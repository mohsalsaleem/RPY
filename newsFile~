            "Story": " NEW DELHI: The internet in India is freer now, but individuals could still to get into trouble for online posts, say digital media and law experts. Hailing the Supreme Court judgment on Tuesday as a landmark verdict for free speech in India, experts who have closely read the judgment say there is much to be careful about too.\nThe scrapping of the contentious section doesn't mean that one has a free run, cautions Sunil Abraham, executive director, Centre for Internet and Society. An online comment can still land you in jail, he says.\n\n\"The judgement in no way means that speech on online platforms will be unregulated now. You can still be charged for pornography or voyeurism under the IT Act. There are many provisions in the Constitution and Indian Penal Code that the government can use to target people it wants to go after. You can be still charged for hate speech or defamation - which is a criminal offence in India - for an online comment,\" says Abraham.\n\nWhile lawyer Apar Gupta found the judgment to be forward-looking, he pointed to Para 98 of the 120 page judgment, which addresses Article 14 of the Constitution regarding \"discrimination\" and talks of the distinction between online and other media.\n\n\"We make it clear that there is an intelligible differentia between speech on the internet and other mediums of communication for which separate offences can certainly be created by legislation,\" says the judgment. \"The court has indicated that special offences can be created for the internet. Constant vigilance is the price of liberty. We need to constantly engage with these issues to keep the internet free,\" says Gupta.\n\nThe judgment has been praised for making a distinction between online posts and messages that pertain to advocacy, discussion and incitement. \"This is an excellent decision. The SC is saying that no matter what the medium, we stand for constitutional rights. The judges were ready to listen, and ready to share their experience of using the internet also,\" says Mishi Choudhary, legal director at Software Freedom Law Center, adding, \"It was a lost opportunity for the Modi government. They should have gotten rid of section 66 A themselves.\"\n\nSection 69A of the Act, which stands as is, allows non-transparent blocking of online content in the interest of \"sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above.\" However, Choudhary says that since it is a narrowly-drawn provision, it ensures more safeguards.\n\n\"It will be noticed that Section 69A unlike Section 66A is a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards. First and foremost, blocking can only be resorted to where the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary so to do. Secondly, such necessity is relatable only to some of the subjects set out in Article 19(2). Thirdly, reasons have to be recorded in writing in such blocking order so that they may be assailed in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution,\" she says.\n\nGoing forward, the government plan of action should focus on balancing safety and freedom on the internet, says Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar, who himself was one of the petitioners. \"The final endgame has to be one where we have a new law or even a new IT Act which meets the twin objectives of a safe and free internet. The two need not be mutually exclusive,\" he says.\n\n<em>(With inputs from Anand J in Bengaluru)</em>\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter </strong>>>><a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\"> @toi_tech</a>\n<strong>And like us on Facebook</strong> >>><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a>\n",

            "Story": " Is Larry Page asleep at the wheel? Because it sure feels like it.\n\nFacebook is conducting an all-out assault on Google. It just launched embeddable videos and a new ad network. Those businesses will compete with YouTube and Google's DoubleClick display ad business.\n\nFacebook has become a juggernaut in video lately, and this will only bolster its position. With its incredible data on users, it will be an attractive destination for video ads and display ads, weakening Google's display business.\n\nGoogle looks like it is basically helpless to stop Facebook. It doesn't have an answer for Facebook. It tried and failed with Google+. Google doesn't own a \"stream\" like Facebook's NewsFeed, where it can stick high-quality brand advertising right into what people are reading and doing.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, as Facebook gets stronger, it looks like Google is running in the wrong direction. It looks like CEO Larry Page has handed off responsibility for the company at a critical time.\n\nWhile Mark Zuckerberg zeros in on real opportunity like mobile ads in the Facebook app, video plays in the app, monetizing Instagram, and building platforms with WhatsApp and Facebook messenger, Larry Page is looking at more pie-in-the-sky stuff like robotics and self driving cars.\n\nRobots and self-driving cars are cool, and we should all be thankful that Google is willing to experiment with them. However, it's not clear they'll ever be huge businesses.\n\nIt feels like Page is bored with the nuts and bolts of running an advertising-based internet company. He seems to think things like Instagram or Snapchat are too prosaic. He isn't going to dive into the display ad business, pushing Google's business to the next level. He'd rather work on changing the world.\n\nZuckerberg, meanwhile, is still interested in pushing his company forward, even if it means working on smaller projects like video ads.\n\nTo be clear, Google is not suddenly going to go kaput. It's not at risk of going out of business. It will continue to mint money. But, it's hard to see where big growth is going to come from.\n\nMobile is neutralizing the power of the search business. People are using apps more and more for their searches.\n\nYouTube is not the business people thought it would be. It did just $4 billion in revenue last year, and it's only breaking even.\n\nAndroid is a fantastically successful mobile operating system, but Apple's iPhone has the most valuable users, and it's taking share from Android. Android has never developed into a real business and it's unclear if it ever will.\n\nWhat is the future of Google's business? Larry Page has been a strong advocate for Google inventing the future through fantastic ideas like balloons that deliver internet, and contacts that measure glucose, and a startup that can prolong our lives. But are those ever going to become businesses?\n\nIn Google's defense, the tech industry tends to move in quick cycles. Just two years ago, the world was in love with Google and thought it was going to be a trillion dollar company. Facebook three years ago was seen as a risky company. Apple was tanking three years ago. Today, that's all turned around. Facebook and Apple are the kings, and people are worried about Google.\n\nSo, it's entirely possible we're being overly harsh reactionaries.\n\nBut, it feels different this time. Right now it feels like Google is directionless and Facebook has all the momentum. It feels like Google could turn into the next Microsoft \u2014 a company with brilliant people and brilliant ideas that fails to deliver, sending the stock sideways for a decade.\n\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>\n\n",

But the odds that a regular person will be there are close to 100 percent.\"</p><p> The New York fire highlighted the potential for these tools, Gillmor said, but some situations could be even more dramatic.</p><p> \"Suppose we had real-time video from someone who was in the front of that (Germanwings) plane (which crashed) over the Alps, showing us a video of the captain trying to get into the cockpit,\" Gillmor told AFP.</p><p> \"We would have a much more graphic and quite terrifying understanding of what happened.\"</p><p> Although technology for live streaming has been available for years, the widespread use of smartphones, improved networks and the integration with Twitter could make these tools more potent, analysts say.</p><p> \"There's nothing quite like live video to put people in the moment when it comes to breaking news,\" said Josh Stearns, who follows citizen journalism at the Geraldine R.

            "Story": " SAN FRANCISCO: Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp agreed to extend by 30 days the deadline to re-negotiate a ten year search deal, as the two internet companies attempt to revamp a thorny partnership crafted by former chief executives.\n\nThe search partnership, which took effect in 2010, allowed the companies to negotiate changes or to terminate the arrangement entirely after five years. Under the terms of the deal, the companies had 30 days to make changes following February 23.\n\nAccording to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Yahoo and Microsoft mutually agreed to extend that deadline to a 60-day period following February 23.\n\n\"We value our partnership with Microsoft and continue discussions about plans for the future. We have nothing further to announce at this time,\" Yahoo said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the extension signaled progress or lack of consensus between Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nThe announcement to extend the talks comes a few days after Nadella's mother passed away in Hyderabad, India, according to a report in The Economic Times.\n\nYahoo and Microsoft began a 10-year search partnership in 2010, in a deal crafted by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and former Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz. The two companies hoped their combined efforts could mount a more competitive challenge to Google Inc, the world's No. 1 search engine.\n\nThe partnership has not lived up to expectations. Google still controls roughly two-thirds of the US search market, while Microsoft and Yahoo's combined share of the market is essentially unchanged at roughly 30%.\n\nYahoo's Mayer, who joined Yahoo in 2012 and who has been critical of the deal in the past, tried to hold off on adopting Microsoft search technology in certain markets in 2013. A court ruled at the time that Yahoo must use Microsoft's search technology.\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter </strong>>>><a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a>\n<strong>And like us on Facebook</strong> >>><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a>",

            "Story": " <em>You need not count sheep to fall asleep. Get these quirky apps and you can experience the real deal and drift away into sleep heaven.</em>\n\n<strong>Sleep Cycle</strong>\n<strong>Available on: iPhone & Android</strong>\n\n<strong>Cost: Paid</strong>\n\nThis one is not `just another sleep app'. It actually monitors your sleep patterns, also called sleep phases. As you sleep, you go through light sleep, deep sleep and a dream state, referred to as REM sleep. Each sleep cycle is about 90-minutes long and is repeated several times depending on the duration of your sleep. What the sleep cycle does is use the phone's accelerometer to identify different phases in your sleep by tracking your movements in bed. Then, depending on your preset settings, it will wake you during your lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window. The results are available in the form of a graphical chart, which shows you how long you were asleep and awake.\n\n<strong>Sleep Genius</strong>\n\n<strong>Available on: iPhone & Android</strong>\n\n<strong>Cost: Paid</strong>\n\nSnoozing never felt this guilt-free! Using specialised audio techniques, the Sleep Genius app uses specially-composed music and sounds incorporating scientific techniques like `binaural beats' and `pink noise'. Along with a combination of neurosensory algorithms and pyschoacoustic music, these sounds are designed to lull you to sleep by relaxing the brain. All you need to do after starting up the app is to download the music you want, select the audio and then programme it to either play continuously or set it with the timer. The best part about this app though, is that there is an alarm option that gradually awakens users and the `power nap' option for those who are looking to catch their 40 winks.\n\n<strong>Relax Melodies</strong>\n\n<strong>Available on: Android & iPhone</strong>\n\n<strong>Cost: Free</strong>\n\nRated as Amazon's Best App of 2012, Relax Melodies is still popular and one of the most highly-recommended sleep apps.

So, one can create a playlist of sorts by selecting the sounds and music they like and slip naturally into a state of deep sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and happier. The app includes eight read ily-available favourites. What makes this app special is that it can be used not just during nap time, but also while exercising, doing yoga, getting a massage or even as a lullaby for your baby.\n\n<strong>Asleep</strong>\n\n<strong>Available on: iPhone</strong>\n\n<strong>Cost: Paid</strong>\n\nCreated in July 2008, aSleep is easily one among the oldest apps out there. Available exclusively on the iPhone platform, its best feature is iPhone platform, its best feature is that it is easy to use. Asleep has three simple settings All you need to do is pick a sound, set the timer, set the alarm, start the clock and you are done!

You can use this app for meditation, yoga and generally to de-stress as well. The sounds available include nature, life, noise (aliens, computer, old clock, keyboard typing), instru ments and get this, even lullabies.\n\n<strong>Sleepmaker Rain</strong>\n\n<strong>Available on: Android & iPhone</strong>\n\n<strong>Cost: Free</strong>\n\nThe soothing sound of rain can lull some people into a deep slumber. Sleepmaker Rain works on the same principle. Safe on children and even infants, the app uses real rain recordings, not just mere effects. These sounds are looped by a motion picture sound engineer and recorded in digitally uncompressed formats. The app includes 17 tracks, which features three different forces of rainfall -gentle, medium and heavy. One can programme the app for any time period ranging from one minute to 23 hours and 59 minutes. Although the Sleepmaker Rain is one of the most popular apps, the company also has a range of other sleep apps like Sleepmaker Storms, Sleepmaker Nature and Sleepmaker Waves -all available on both iPhone and Android platforms.

            "Story": " BENGALURU: India's third largest software exporter Wipro has undertaken another reshuffle in its key Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) business, by splitting it between two leaders \u2014 one overseeing the US and other key markets and the other overseeing Europe and South Africa.\n\nIn an internal announcement on Friday, Wipro said Angan Arun Guha \u2014 currently global head of Citigroup business unit at the company \u2014 will head North America, Australia, India, Middle East and emerging markets. Wipro has plucked out Shailendra Singh from the South Africa division to oversee the rest of the world. Citigroup is one the top customers for Wipro globally.\n\nBoth Guha and Singh will report to Shaji Farooq \u2014 a former Infosys veteran who joined Wipro in 2012 and currently heads the BFSI business. The new structure will be in place from April 1.\n\nRestructuring in the BFSI business comes as the Bengaluru-based firm is desperately trying to catch up with rivals such as TCS, Infosys and Cognizant in the banking outsourcing sector, after lagging for years.\n\n\"Under this structure, while Angan Arun Guha, vice president will lead the vertical in North America, Australia, India, Middle East & Emerging Markets. Shailendra Singh, who heads Wipro's operations in South Africa, will lead the BFSI vertical in Europe & South Africa. Both Angan and Shailendra will report to Shaji Farooq, chief executive and global head \u2014 BFSI, Wipro,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nWipro generates just over a quarter of its overall revenues from the BFSI business, which pales in comparison to rivals such as TCS, US-based Cognizant and even cross-town rival Infosys, which has lagged industry growth rates over the last 4 years and lost its prized bellwether tag.\n\nTCS generates about 45% of its overall revenues from its banking business, while Infosys generates about 35% from such clients. The latest reshuffle also comes after previous banking and financial services head Rajan Kohli moved to a new role to head Wipro's digital business and after banking products head Balasubramanian Ganesh exited Wipro.\n\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>",

            "Story": " NEW DELHI: Air travellers in India could in the coming months surf the web while flying, with the government finally warming up to the idea of Wi-Fi-based internet connections on flights, meeting a longstanding demand of both airlines and passengers.\n\nA senior civil aviation ministry official said his ministry has approached the department of telecommunications (DoT) with the proposal and will make a formal announcement soon. \"The DoT has already said (informally) the proposal is possible to implement,\" he said, asking not to be named.\n\nDoT allots spectrum, or airwaves, capacity to operators to provide telecom and broadband services. In India, only foreign airlines such as Emirates, Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines offer internet connectivity on international flights.\n\nSanjiv Kapoor, COO of budget airline SpiceJet, said several airlines had expressed interest in the proposal.\n\n\"It is a welcome proposal, it is allowed in many other places of the world. In the US these days, it is rare to be on a flight that does not have Wi-Fi,\" he said.\n\nKapil Kaul, South Asia chief executive of aviation consultancy Capa, said the development is good for customers, especially business travelers. Surfing the web on flights appeals to travellers because they can be more productive or fight boredom.\n\nLike the use of mobile phones onboard even in flight mode, Wi-Fi and other technologies require regulatory clearances. Airlines typically provide Wi-Fi services by installing on board planes a server that hooks up with a ground-based mobile broadband network or links to satellites.\n\nThe number of commercial airplanes globally with Wi-Fi, cell service or both is expected to more than triple over the next 10 years to 14,000, with Asia spawning most of the growth, according to research firm IHS.\n\n<strong>Revenue source</strong>\n\nFor airlines, desperate for new sources of revenue because of their wafer-thin margins, Wi-Fi will be a possibly lucrative service to sell. But globally, the service hasn't been a huge money spinner for airlines because equipping fleets with Wi-Fi, especially via satellites, is costly and few carriers have found a profitable way to cover costs.\n\nRevenues are scant because not many passengers are willing to pay for a service that is costly, slow (air-to-ground technology delivers browsing speeds of 3.1Mbps for an entire flight) or both.\n\nKaul said installation costs and pricing will be a challenge. \"I see (only) Air Asia India and Vistara investing in on-board Wi-Fi.\" Air Asia India CEO Mittu Chandilya said he has been personally asking authorities to allow Wi-Fi on flights. He said he will have to look at the policy and specifications to comment on how soon passengers can expect the service.\n\nPhee Teik Yeoh, CEO, Vistara, said the government's proposal is a positive move as the needs and expectations of airline customers are ever evolving. He said deploying Wi-Fi on board involves planning and development of infrastructure with partners at multiple levels. \"We look forward to the government's early approval and we shall work with our partners to soon develop an integrated on board Wi-Fi service for our customers.\"\n\nAditya Ghosh, president of Indi-Go, India's largest airline, said passengers cannot expect Wi-Fi on flights \"in the near future.\" SpiceJet's Kapoor said his airline is very interested in introducing Wi-Fi on flights, but the first goal would be to install an intranet that flyers could access. Such systems do not require connections to external servers. Passengers can avail media streaming on their portable electronic devices, but cannot surf the internet.\n\n<strong>Wi-Fi in airport</strong>\n\nThe aviation ministry also plans to introduce free Wi-Fi in 30 major airports across the country, said the ministry official cited earlier. \"Wi-Fi will be free for the first 30 minutes and passengers will be charged a nominal fee beyond.\" The ministry has identified airports in metros and state capitals for the service. These airports are managed by the government-run Airports Authority of India (AAI).\n\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>",

            "Story": " MUMBAI: Idea Cellular is not overly concerned about being saddled with a bill of more than Rs 30,000 crore that it bid for airwaves in the just-ended auction, unlike investors who dragged the stock down on Friday.\n\nIndia's third-largest phone company sees things differently \u2014 it now has clarity about the next 20 years, which includes tapping the country's surging data growth.\n\n\"We only have to look ahead,\" Idea CEO Himanshu Kapania told ET in an interview. He said that the airwaves that have been acquired mean Idea can launch improved 3G services on the cost-efficient 900Mhz band.\n\nWith 3G in Kolkata, the Aditya Birla group company will be covering 80%, or 13 circles, of the pricier and higher-margin, high-speed data market.\n\nFor the future, Idea already has airwaves to deploy 4G services across 10 circles, accounting for 61% of the company's current revenue, Kapania added.\n\n<strong>High Cost Drags Stock Down 5%</strong>\n\n\"We are among the only operators to have renewed, or gotten new licences, in 16 circles since 2012, covering 85% of our overall revenue,\" he said. This gives the mobile phone operator business certainty over the next two decades, or the life of a licence, for a bulk of its revenue-generating service areas.\n\nIdea was the highest bidder, making bids worth Rs 30,100 crore, jostling with bigger rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India, apart from Reliance Jio Infocomm, to win back its airwaves in nine expiring circles where it held the cost-efficient 900Mhz band and which made up more than 70% of its revenue.\n\nIt also bought airwaves in the 1800MHz band in six circles and the 2100MHz in Kolkata. The 900Mhz band can also be used to offer 3G services, under new rules.\n\n\"We now have the ability to launch better-quality 3G services in the 900MHz band in premium markets of Delhi and Maharashtra,\" Kapania said, adding that Mumbai would make a logical fit, but the price of 3G airwaves in that circle was too costly. Similarly, the company chose not to bid for 3G airwaves in Delhi and Andhra Pradesh, he added. The government has promised to sell more 3G spectrum in a year.\n\nThe high cost of Idea's airwaves dragged the stock down 5% at Friday's close to Rs 171.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, underperforming the broader market. Investors fear higher debt will hurt the company's profitability, and thus its ability to undertake the capital expenditure that's needed.\n\n\"We believe Idea will be significantly constrained in the scenario of rapid growth of data in India as it would have inadequate spectrum in key markets,\" said an investor note by Deutsche Bank. It explained that while bigger competitors Vodafone India and Bharti Airtel captured incremental amounts of spectrum, nearly 90% of Idea's budget was spent on renewals.\n\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>",

            "Story": " Silicon Valley is enamored of \"disrupters,\" those shrewd, brave men \u2014 it is almost always men \u2014 who are hailed for enduring years of ridicule and risking everything to shake up the conventional order.\n\nNow, in Ellen Pao, the Valley has found its newest disrupter. And the conventional order she has shaken up concerns the Valley itself and the clubby way of doing things in a place that fancies itself the emerging center of the world.\n\nOften, Silicon Valley's disrupters do not succeed on the terms they initially envision. So it was on Friday when a jury decided that Ms. Pao's claims of gender discrimination against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers were without merit.\n\nBut while the verdict is a defeat for Ms. Pao, a former junior investing partner at the firm who stood to win potentially tens of millions in damages if she prevailed, the trial has nevertheless accomplished something improbable.\n\nNot only have weeks of testimony revealed a collection of boorish, unsavory and at times unwittingly misogynist attitudes at one of the tech industry's most storied financial institutions, the case has also come to stand for something bigger than itself. It has blown open a conversation about the status of women in an industry that, for all its talk of transparency and progress, has always been buttoned up about its shortcomings.\n\nThanks to Ms. Pao, and notwithstanding the jury's verdict, the secrets are suddenly out in the open. In tweets, in text messages and at tech gatherings like TED and South by Southwest, the case has been virtually all that anyone could talk about during the last few weeks.\n\n\"To say that it is a frequent topic of conversation would be an understatement,\" said Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the Kapor Center for Social Impact. \"It has been a constant topic of conversation here amongst people beyond the usual suspects \u2014 beyond the group of people who talk about diversity efforts in tech start-ups.\"\n\nThe floodgates may already be creaking open. After the Pao testimony, former employees of Facebook and of Twitter have filed gender-discrimination suits against those companies, which have denied the accusations.\n\nMs. Klein argued that the Kleiner trial would become a landmark case for women in the workplace, as consequential for corporate gender relations as Anita Hill's accusations in 1991 of sexual harassment during the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nIn that case, too, the accuser did not prevail; Mr. Thomas, the man alleged to have sexually harassed Ms. Hill, was elevated to, and remains on, the Supreme Court. And yet, \"In that case, what happened was a public discourse began about issues that people had previously wrestled with privately,\" said Ms. Klein.\n\nThe Kleiner-Pao trial has prompted a similar discussion because the series of large and small slights that Ms. Pao contends she suffered at the hands of her male colleagues and bosses at Kleiner has resonated with women across the industry, and it has turned a light on problems that many men around here have long kept under wraps.\n\n\"Ellen's experiences rang true,\" Ms. Klein said. \"They struck a chord.\"\n\nMs. Pao is far from the first woman in the tech industry to allege discrimination in the workplace. But she has a resume \u2014 with three Ivy League degrees and a string of executive jobs \u2014 that put her in a rarefied position.\n\nAs one of the few women admitted into the venture capital industry, she gained entree into an upper echelon where most women stay silent when they experience wrongdoing for fear of being shut out of the industry entirely.\n\nAs a consequence, though many women in the tech industry have stories similar to Ms. Pao's, they are rarely heard from.\n\n\"What usually happens when you have something like this happen to you at work is that you negotiate a settlement with a gag order,\" said Melinda Byerley, a marketing consultant who has worked in the tech industry for more than a decade. \"They pay you to be quiet. This happens all over Silicon Valley \u2014 they will write you a severance agreement outlining X number of months' salary, X number of shares, and along with that is a gag order.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is how women have been doing this for more than a decade. This is tribal knowledge. It's shared from one woman to the next.\" What made Ms. Pao's story unusual, Ms. Byerley said, was her refusal to take the quiet settlement, despite the risks to her reputation and her career.\n\nThe particulars of Ms. Pao's complaint also resonated. Documents in the case showed that one Kleiner partner, Chi-Hua Chien, arranged a ski trip for entrepreneurs from which women were excluded. When he was asked if a female entrepreneur from one of the companies Kleiner had invested in could come along, Mr. Chien responded in an email that because the trip involved shared accommodations, women probably wouldn't feel comfortable.\n\n\"Why don't we punt on her and find 2 guys who are awesome,\" he wrote. \"We can add 4-8 women next year.\" There was no ski trip the next year.\n\nOr there was the time Ms. Pao and another female partner were made to sit at the back of the room and not at the conference table during a meeting. Or the plane ride in which, Ms. Pao asserted, her male colleagues discussed pornography stars and assessed the attractiveness of Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo.\n\nThe jury clearly found that none of this strayed into illegal territory.\n\nBut several women across the industry told me that when they listened to Ms. Pao's case against Kleiner, they heard echoes of experiences they and others like them had seen in their own lives.\n\nTo several women in the industry, the most salient note in Ms. Pao's complaint was her claim that there was a narrow band of behavior she was expected to adhere to at Kleiner. She was criticized both for being too timid and for being too aggressive, for speaking up too much and for not speaking up enough.\n\nWorse, criticisms of her performance were vague and unspecific. In written evaluations by her peers and executives at Kleiner's portfolio companies, Ms. Pao was often given high marks, but Kleiner partners testified that her failings were a more subtle failure of \"chemistry.\"\n\nJust about every woman who has worked in Silicon Valley has dealt with the challenge of operating within these vague expectations of cultural compatibility. But some hold out hope that the trial will highlight the issue to the men who run the place.\n\n\"Many men in the Valley genuinely believe that their company is a meritocracy,\" said Karen Catlin, a former software engineer and a former vice president of Adobe Systems. \"They think that the gender problem is something that happens somewhere else. It's my sincere hope that because Kleiner is so well known, they'll see that this problem is not at the corner. It's at the heartbeat. And after this, we'll have a series of cautionary tales about what not to do going forward.\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter </strong>>>><a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a>\n<strong>And like us on Facebook </strong>>>><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a>\n",

We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law,\" Cook tweeted on Friday to his 1 million-plus followers. \"Around the world, we strive to treat every customer the same -- regardless of where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"\n\nLegal experts say the act sets a legal standard that will allow people of all faiths to bring religious freedom claims, but opinions differ over its impact.\n\nSupporters of the bill, which was passed overwhelmingly by both chambers of the Republican-controlled state legislature, say it will keep the government from forcing business owners to act against strongly held religious beliefs.\n\nOpponents say it is discriminatory and broader than other state religious freedom laws. Gay rights groups worry it will be used by businesses that do not want to provide services for same-sex weddings. Gay marriage became legal in Indiana last year, following an appeals court ruling.\n\nOther tech CEOs have also spoken out against the bill. Benioff said on Twitter that his San Francisco-based company would cancel programs that require travel to Indiana.

            "Story": " SEOUL: A $50 portable media player is providing many North Koreans a window to the outside world despite the government's efforts to keep its people isolated -- a symbol of change in one of the world's most repressed societies.\n\nBy some estimates, up to half of all urban North Korean households have an easily concealed \"notel\", a small portable media player used to watch DVDs or content stored on USB sticks that can be easily smuggled into the country and passed hand to hand.\n\nPeople are exchanging South Korean soaps, pop music, Hollywood films and news programmes, all of which are expressly prohibited by the Pyongyang regime, according to North Korean defectors, activists and recent visitors to the isolated country.\n\n\"The North Korean government takes their national ideology extremely seriously, so the spread of all this media that competes with their propaganda is a big and growing problem for them,\" said Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), an organization that works with defectors.\n\n\"If Pyongyang fails to successfully adapt to these trends, they could threaten the long-term survival of the regime itself.\"\n\nNorth Koreans have been spending money more openly, a sign that some forms of entrepreneurship are increasingly tolerated and that the state is easing some of its harsh controls over the economy. In recent months, consumption has become more conspicuous.\n\n\"The variety and number of places for locals to spend money has really increased,\" said one regular visitor to Pyongyang, declining to be identified. \"People seem a lot more confident flashing the cash than they used to be. I've seen people spend $500 on a phone with no hesitation, for example.\"\n\nThere is no sign, however, that the regime in nuclear-capable North Korea is loosening its grip, looking to make substantial reforms or making any change in its unpredictable ways of dealing with the outside world.\n\nBut along with rising incomes, more goods are available in the impoverished country, mostly on the black market but also in some state-controlled stores.\n\n<strong>Cheap and versatile</strong>\nNotel or 'notetel' -- the name is a uniquely North Korean word combining 'notebook' and 'television' -- are easily found on the black market for around 300 Chinese yuan ($48), and are also available in some state shops and markets.\n\nThe device was legalized last year, according to defector-run news outlets in Seoul -- one of many recent measures taken by the state to accommodate grassroots change.\n\nThe new rules, however, also require North Koreans to register their notel, enabling authorities to monitor who is most likely to be watching banned foreign media.\n\nNorth Koreans do not have access to the internet -- those who can go online are limited to a state-run intranet, while the country's 2.5 million mobile phone subscribers are not allowed to call outside the country.\n\nThe notel comes from China, either smuggled or legally imported.\n\nLee Seok-young, a defector from the North, said he smuggled 18,000 Chinese-made notel into the country last year. He said he ordered them directly from a factory in Guangzhou that was likely still in production solely to satisfy the demands of the North Korean market.\n\nThe devices have lost their popularity in China over the years, but still sell well in the provinces bordering North Korea, according to data on the China-based online shopping website Taobao.\n\nWhen asked to quote a wholesale price for notel, one Chinese trader in the border city of Yanji said: \"You want to send them to North Korea? How many do you want to send? They sell well there.\"\n\nThe low-voltage notel differs from the portable DVD players of the late 1990s in that they have USB and SD card ports, and a built-in TV and radio tuner. They can also be charged with a car battery -- an essential piece of household equipment in electricity-scarce North Korea.\n\nLegally-registered notel must be fixed to official state television and radio channels, according to the Daily NK, a Seoul-based news organization run by defectors.\n\nLee, the defector, said the device's multi-function nature makes it easier for users to get away with watching illegal material.\n\n\"To avoid getting caught, people load a North Korean DVD while watching South Korean dramas on a USB stick, which can be pulled out,\" he said. \"They then tell the authorities, who feel the heat from the notel to check whether or not it has been recently used, that they were watching North Korean films\".\n\nPark at the LiNK organization added: \"They are small enough to roll up in a blanket and hide in a wardrobe. They have become so popular because they are perfect for overcoming the twin barriers to foreign media consumption: surveillance and power outages.\n\n\"If you were to design the perfect device for North Koreans, it would be this.\"\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>\n\n",

            "Story": " Internet outages can disrupt emergency services, business transactions and basic communication. Here are few things to know about the US's internet infrastructure and its vulnerabilities.\n\n<strong>How it works</strong>\nIn many cases, information is transmitted at high speeds through light waves carried in slender glass fibers that are bundled together and strung along rights of way such as highways, railroads and pipelines. When covering long distances, these fiber-optic cables often are shared, meaning they might carry internet, telephone, television and data services for a variety of companies.\n\n<strong>Rural-urban divide</strong>\nIn major cities, the demand for high-speed internet means there are typically multiple fiber-optic cables delivering service. If a main line is damaged, Internet traffic can be routed to another path. But in rural areas and smaller cities, these network redundancies sometimes don't exist because they are viewed as too costly. When a fiber-optic cable gets cut in those places, it can take much longer to restore service.\n\n<strong>Increasing outages</strong>\nThe number of outages affecting high-capacity lines has been steadily rising, from 221 in 2010 to 418 in 2012 and 487 in 2014, according to figures from the Federal Communications Commission. That comes as the nation's fiber-optic network also has been expanding by about 10 million miles of fiber annually, according to an industry group. More fiber-optic cables means there are more chances for them to get accidently cut, vandalized or develop problems.\n\n<strong>Government oversight</strong>\nInternet infrastructure in the US has been largely unregulated by the federal government and the states. Federal agencies, for example, are distributing billions of dollars to help expand broadband into unserved areas but have not required the grant recipients to build backup systems that could guard against outages. The Federal Communications Commission has been more focused on ensuring open access on the internet. It recently raised the target speeds for what it considers to be appropriate broadband service.\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>\n\n",

Contiguous, or full 5MHz slots, frequency is necessary for good quality 4G LTE on 800Mhz.\n\nBulk of Jio's full 5MHz slot wins in 800MHz band, historically used by CDMA players but that can support 4G services in future, are in Category-C circles like Assam, Northeast, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa, the brokerage said.\n\nThe Tatas, whose collective bids were worth Rs 7,851.33 crore, have beefed up CDMA spectrum holdings by acquiring 11.25 units of 800MHz airwaves in their key markets like Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Mumbai, Haryana and Maharashtra. Their CDMA spectrum is coming up for renewal in Mumbai, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh in September 2017.\n\nIn addition, Tata Tele also bagged 2.6 units of 2G airwaves in 1800MHz in Andhra Pradesh. Analysts were surprised by the company's aggression. \"We were surprised to see Tata acquiring some 11 units in five circles and paying a whopping Rs 6,100 crore, roughly 78% of its total outgo, on just three circles (Mumbai, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh),\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a note to clients.\n\nThere was a clamour for the band since delivery of 4G services on the 800MHz band is seen to have strong business potential in India by virtue of superior propagation characteristics coupled with emerging LTE ecosystem.\n\nMore so, since the government is yet to finalize a roadmap for auctioning super-efficient 4G airwaves in the 700MHz band. Tata Teleservices declined comment on its CDMA spectrum wins or on whether its bidding strategy was also aimed at boosting valuation.\n\n\n<strong>Follow TOI Tech on Twitter >>> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toi_tech\" target=\"_blank\">@toi_tech</a></strong>\n<strong>Like TOI Tech on Facebook >>> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TOItech\" target=\"_blank\">TOI_tech</a></strong>",
